# ResNet34
This project takes a look into implementing the ResNet34 architecture from the ground-up as per the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385) published in 2015. Furthermore, this project dives a bit into understanding what each set of convolution and residual layer types have learned from their inputs.
